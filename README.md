Introduction

Traditional Karate training relies on direct interaction and immediate feedback, which are challenging to replicate in an online setting.
While theoretical content can be effectively taught online, practical skills are harder to convey and maintaining student engagement is crucial. 
This study explores using wearable technology and 3D modeling to improve the learning experience by offering interactive visualization, real-time feedback, and detailed movement analysis. 
Gamification elements, such as rewards and badges, can enhance motivation. 
The goal is to bridge the gap between virtual and physical training and evaluate the effectiveness of these technologies compared to traditional in-person instruction
